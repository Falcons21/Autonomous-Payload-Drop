# Autonomous-Payload-Drop

Matlab based Trajectory Simulation of the Actual Code that will run on Data Acqusition System onboard the Primary Aircraft.

* Drag values for Howlers and Water Bottles (Supply Payloads) were computed using Computational Fluid Dynamics.

* Drag Coefficients (Cd) for the respective payloads were calcualted using Drag Equation.
* Calculated values along with Airspeed, Average Wind Speed (in Lakeland, Florida) were added to the matlab code.
