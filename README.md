# Autonomous-Payload-Drop

Matlab based Trajectory Simulation of the Actual Code that will run on Data Acquisition System onboard the Primary Aircraft.

* Drag values for Howlers and Water Bottles (Supply Payloads) were computed using Computational Fluid Dynamics.

* Drag Coefficients (Cd) for the respective payloads were calculated using Drag Equation.
* Calculated values along with Airspeed, Average Wind Speed (in Lakeland, Florida) were added to the Matlab code.
